# nonogram_solver

This program is part of the assessment work of the course "B4B36ZUI - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" lectured at FEE CTU in Prague.

Nonograms (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram) are brain teasers, defined by a legend linked to a grid used to draw a picture. Each number in the legend sets the number of the following boxes filled with color which belongs to the given number. The following rules hold:

- there is always at least one empty box between two blocks of the boxes filled with the same color
- there does not have to be an empty box between the boxes filled with different color
- the order of the numbers in the legend corresponds to the order of the blocks of the boxes (from left to right, from top to bottom)
